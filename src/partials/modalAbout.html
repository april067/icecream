    Ice cream has been around a long time. Some sources mention ice cream-like
    foods originating in Persia in about 550BC. Some even believe that the Roman
    Emperor Nero had snow collected from the mountains and mixed with honey and
    wine to make sorbet. These days we have hundreds of different types of ice
    cream, from the usual ice cream van favourites to gourmet gelatos and
    experimental savoury flavours.
